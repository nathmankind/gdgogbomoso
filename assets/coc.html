            GDG Ogbomoso is a chapter of the larger Google Developer community,
            as such we follow and enforce the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/groups/guidelines/"
              >GOOGLE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY GUIDELINES.</a
            >
            We, the group organizers and/or event organizers, reserve the right
            to take any action that we see fit against any person or persons
            that are found to be in breach of these guidelines including;
            issuing a warning (verbal or written), asking the offending person
            or persons to leave the event, or expulsion from the group.

          <h4>Don't Be A Jerk</h4>
          <p>
            GDG Ogbomoso prides itself on being an open, respectful, and
            inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn't allowed at GDG
            meetings. Because we know that it's not obvious to everyone, here's
            a reminder of things we don't allow: jokes or offensive comments
            about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing
            porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact
            with someone after they've asked you to stop. Continuous jerky
            behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting or GDG
            Chapter. If someone is bothering you, please tell the GDG Organizers
            or event host and they will take care of it. We want to maintain GDG
            Ogbomoso's awesomeness.

          <h4>Anti-Harassment Policy</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Why do we have an official Anti-Harassment policy for GDG Ogbomoso
              events?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It sets expectations for behavior at the event. Simply having an
              anti-harassment policy can prevent harassment.
            </li>
            <li>
              It encourages people to attend who have had bad experiences at
              other events
            </li>
            <li>
              It gives event staff/volunteers instructions on how to handle
              harassment quickly, with minimum amount of disruption for the
              event.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            GDG Ogbomoso is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event
            experience for everyone, regardless of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>gender</li>
            <li>sexual orientation</li>
            <li>disability</li>
            <li>gender identity</li>
            <li>age</li>
            <li>race</li>
            <li>nationality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The above is not an exhaustive list -- we do not tolerate harassment
            of event participants in any form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue,
            including talks. Event participants violating these rules may be
            expelled from the event, and event banned from future events at the
            discretion of the event organizers/management.
          </p>
          <p>Harassment includes (but is not limited to):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
              disability, gender identity, age, race, religion
            </li>
            <li>the use or display of sexual images in public spaces</li>
            <li>deliberate intimidation</li>
            <li>stalking</li>
            <li>harassing photography or recording</li>
            <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
            <li>inappropriate physical contact</li>
            <li>unwelcome sexual attention</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
            comply immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exhibiting partners and guests are also subject to the
            anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors and speakers
            should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material, or
            otherwise create a sexualized environment in their slide decks,
            exhibit material, exhibit staffing, promotional items or demo
            material.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
            harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer or
            event volunteer immediately. Organizers and event volunteers may be
            identified by t-shirts or special badges/lanyards. Organizers will
            investigate the issue and take appropriate action. This may include
            helping participants contact venue security or local law
            enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist these experiencing
            harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. <br />
            Though we hope that we never have to invoke this policy, we believe
            that having this document helps everyone think a little more about
            how their actions and words affect the whole community, as well as
            individuals in the community.
